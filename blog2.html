				<h1>Home Away From Home</h1>

				<p class="textCenter">“Home is a place you grow up wanting to leave and grow old wanting to get back to.”</p>
				<p class="textRight">-John Ed Pearce</p>

				<p>I grew up in a beautiful small town with a small community where everyone knew each other. Due to the lack of proper education, from a very young age, I wanted to escape the small town life and figure out who I am. I always felt I was in the spotlight, with the same familiar faces every year and the pressure to please everyone was no easy task. So I decided once I move away, I am not looking back. This promise to myself restricted me from forging a strong bond with my community and cherishing the friends I have made. After “escaping” the small town life, what I learned changed who I am today, but I’m getting ahead of myself.</p>

				<p>Since I can remember I was always attracted to the world of technology, so much so that other areas felt insignificant. With the hopes and dreams of any college student, I traveled thousands of miles to get the best education at the University at Buffalo. The strong desire to prove myself motivated me to get good grades and kept me on my toes. I applied for a part-time job on campus, after I was rejected I understood that grades are not really important. They are not an accurate representation of intelligence, so I started branching out trying to learn different things. This was when I found an amazing opportunity which required me to connect with my hometown through the language “Odia”. Seizing the opportunity, was the best decision I have made.</p>

				<p>With this job, I was in a unique position to use the knowledge and skills I never thought I would. I was hired as a translator/transcriber for “Odia”. All the time I spent learning Odia and the history of my town, although limited for educational purposes helped me a lot. I was assigned to translate interviews with farmers from Odisha. This made me research about the agriculture and history of a small town. I have spent hours over the phone with my parents talking about the culture and heritage it has to offer.</p>

				<p>Furthermore, I spent hours reading research papers online about the policies and facilities being provided to the farmers and their families. Their limitations and concerns were mostly regarding the weather and the delay in government initiatives. I have learned not only the definition but also the value of the words like revenue, equity, equality, etc. While reading these research papers I understood the importance of agriculture and farmers in our lives today. I even visited farms during my visit back home in order to gain a better perspective of my learning. In some ways I now find myself wanting to get back and do something for my community. Growing up in a beautiful small town has shaped me into the person I am today and I am proud to be a part of this community.</p>
